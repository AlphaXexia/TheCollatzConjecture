# The Collatz Conjecture

This is a graph of the Collatz conjecture asserts that the total stopping time of every n is finite. It is also equivalent to saying that every n â‰¥ 2 has a finite stopping time. This definition yields smaller values for the stopping time and total stopping time without changing the overall dynamics of the process.
